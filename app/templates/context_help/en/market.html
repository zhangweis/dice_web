<h1>Market Rules Summary</h1>

Let's assume the BTSX : USD market where BTSX is priced in terms of USD. For the purpose of providing concrete examples, we will assume a median price of $0.03 per BTSX.
={{market.name}}=
<ol>
  <li>51 delegates or more must publish a price feed at least once per day
    <ul>
      <li>if they do not publish the feed, then the market reverts to a 1hr moving average.</li>
      <li>if a feed is published, the 1hr moving average is set to the feed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No short orders can be published to the network at a price 11% above the 1 hour moving average. (ie: they must be
      less than 0.0333)
    <ul>
      <li>the minimal short quantity is 100 BTSX</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Short orders will only be matched against asks that are below the moving average. (ie: people must be selling BTSX
      for less than $0.03)
    <ul>
      <li>the highest short order is matched first, so a short selling USD at $0.03333 will be matched against someone
          buying USD at $.02999 and the difference (0.003333) * volume is captured as a fee.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A margin call will be executed any time the highest bid is greater than 90% of the moving average and the highest
      bid is less than the call price.
    <ul>
      <li>the initial call price is 66% of the short price (ie: $0.022 for a short entered at $.033). This is the price
          at which 75% of the collateral would be required to buy back the USD necessary to cover the position.
      </li>
      <li>If a margin call is executed and there is any collateral left over, then 5% is kept as network fees and 95% is
          returned to the owner.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    There are no restrictions on what prices people can set for normal BitUSD/BTSX trading. All parties will receive
    what they ask for.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rounding errors are inevitable when using fixed point math, any such rounding error is deemed to be a network fee.
    <ul>
      <li>for example you may place an order to buy $1.00 USD but end up with $0.99999 USD.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The network saves all fees earned in USD and in the event that a short position lacks the necessary collateral to
    cover during rapid market movements, then the network will provide the stored USD.
  </li>
  <li>You cannot use the collateral of your short position to buy the USD necessary to cover the position. This USD must
      be purchased separately.
    <ul>
      <li>This requirement creates a kind of "virtual collateral" that all shorts must maintain so they can cover for
          either profit taking or loss prevention.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When you partially cover a position it will reduce your exposure, but your collateral is not returned until the
    position is fully covered.
  </li>
</ol>
